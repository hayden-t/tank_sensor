measurements made with oscilloscope measuring voltage drop across 5ohm resistor (tests as 5.4 omh)

600ms @ 27ma (144mv) - sensor read 0.0045 mah
200ms @ 8.14ma (44mv) - read battery 0.00045 mah
100ms @ 13ma (72mv) - tx rise 0.00036 mah

70ms @ 60ma (308mv) - tx (depend on retries) 0.0011mah
1000ms @ 13ma (72mv) - tx idle 0.0036mah


x3 transmits @ 0.0047mah each = 0.0141mah

sleep

0.01941 mah per reading

@10min interval

0.11646 mah/hr
2.79504 mah/day

found 1.98 mah/day in a sleep wake up delay !

4.77504 mah/day

@ 800mah capacity 167 days, 5.5 months theoretical

14ua 0.014ma sleep

device actually lasted ~4 months (was some periods where moisture ingressed, and maybe casued voltage seep/drain ?)

code adjustments:

1.98 mah/day sleep commented out

removed 100ms from sensor turn off delay
reduced sensor read rise delay by 400ms
added tx repeat break if successful transmit ack from base
made only delay after tx if going to tx again
reduced tx delay 1000 to 100
reduced 2 rise time delays 100 to 10
added debug option for all serial outputs
